# my-hotel-boking-form
Welcome to the Hotel booking form with React.js and a crypto payment gateway integration:

This project is a simple hotel booking form that allows users to pay for their reservation using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The form includes basic information such as the user's name, email, check-in and check-out dates, and the number of guests.

To use the crypto payment system, users can select their preferred cryptocurrency from a drop-down menu and enter their wallet address. Once the user submits the form, they will be directed to a payment gateway where they can complete the transaction.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js and Express.js for the backend. The crypto payment system was implemented using the Coinbase Commerce API.

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the command npm start to start the server.

Once the server is running, you can access the hotel booking form in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

Thank you for checking out the Hotel Booking Form with Crypto Payment System!
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
