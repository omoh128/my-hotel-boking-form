# my-hotel-boking-form
Welcome to the Hotel booking form with React.js and a crypto payment gateway integration:

This project is a simple hotel booking form that allows users to pay for their reservation using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The form includes basic information such as the user's name, email, check-in and check-out dates, and the number of guests.

To use the crypto payment system, users can select their preferred cryptocurrency from a drop-down menu and enter their wallet address. Once the user submits the form, they will be directed to a payment gateway where they can complete the transaction.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js and Express.js for the backend. The crypto payment system was implemented using the Coinbase Commerce API.

To use this project, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the command npm start to start the server.

Once the server is running, you can access the hotel booking form in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

Thank you for checking out the Hotel Booking Form with Crypto Payment System!
